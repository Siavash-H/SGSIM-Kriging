This repository was based on assignments regarding basic coding of "Sequential Gaussian simulation" and "Variogram modeling and Kriging".
Ordinary Kriging and simple Kriging were used to interpolate a limited set of data (porosity) to 100by100 areas.
Then "Sequential Gaussian Simulation" was implemented on the same dataset and results were compared.
